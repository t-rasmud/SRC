\section{Evaluation\label{sec:results}}
To evaluate the usability of \theDeterminismChecker,
we applied it to the Randoop test
generator~\cite{PachecoLEB2007}.
Randoop is intended to be deterministic, when invoked on a deterministic
program~\cite{randoop-manual}.\footnote{Users of Randoop can pass in a different seed in order to
    obtain a different deterministic output.  Randoop has command-line
    options that enable concurrency and timeouts, both of which can lead to
    nondeterministic behavior.}
However, Randoop was not deterministic.  This caused the developers
problems in 
reproducing bugs reported by users, 
reproducing test failures during development, and
understanding the effect of changes to Randoop by comparing executions of two
similar variants of Randoop.

We first wrote specifications for libraries Randoop uses, such as the JDK,
JUnit, and plume-util.
Then, we wrote type qualifiers in the Randoop source code to express its
determinism specification.
Finally, we ran
\theDeterminismChecker.  Each warning indicated a mismatch between the
specification and the implementation.  We addressed each warning by changing our
specification, reporting a bug in Randoop, or suppressing a false positive warning.

\TheDeterminismChecker found \numRandoopBugs previously-unknown nondeterminism bugs in Randoop.
The Randoop developers accepted our bug reports and committed fixes to the repository. Examples
of severe bugs follow, according to the Randoop developers' categorization:

\begin{itemize}
    \item
    \textbf{HashSet bug}: Suppose that in the code under test, a type variable's lower or upper
    bound has a type parameter that the type variable itself does not have. Then Randoop is nondeterministic.
    This situation does occur, even in Randoop's test suite.
    The developers fixed this by changing a \<HashSet> to \<LinkedHashSet>
    (commit c975a9f7, shown in \cref{fig:randoop-bug-hashset}).
    \TheDeterminismChecker confirmed that 
    25 other uses of \<new HashSet> were acceptable, as were 15 uses of \<new HashMap>.
    \item
    \textbf{Classpath bug}
    Randoop used the CLASSPATH environment variable in preference to the
    classpath passed on the command line.
    This can cause incorrect behavior, both in Randoop's test suite and in the field,
    if a user sets the environment variable.
    The developers fixed the problem by changing Randoop to not read the environment variable
    (commit 330e3c56).
    \TheDeterminismChecker verified that all other uses of system and Java
    properties did not lead to nondeterministic behavior.
\end{itemize}

\section{Research Contributions\label{sec:contributions}}
This paper makes the following contributions:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item We designed a type system for expressing determinism properties.

  \item We implemented the analysis, as a pluggable type system for Java, in a
    tool called \theDeterminismChecker.

  \item In a case study, we ran our analysis on a 24 KLOC project that
    developers had already spent weeks of testing and inspection effort to
    make deterministic.  \TheDeterminismChecker
    discovered 5 instances of nondeterminism that the developers had
    overlooked.
\end{enumerate}
