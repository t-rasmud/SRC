\section{Background and Related Work\label{sec:related}}
% Other researchers have also recognized the importance of the problem of nondeterminism.
Previous work has focused on unsound dynamic
approaches that identify flaky test cases.
NonDex~\cite{ShiGLM2016} uses a modified JVM that returns different results on different
executions, for a few key JDK methods with loose specifications.  Running a
test suite multiple times might reveal unwarranted dependence on those
methods.
DeFlaker~\cite{BellLHEYM2018} looks at a range of commit versions
of a code, and marks a test as flaky if it doesn't execute any modified
code but still fails in the newer version.

Our analysis works at compile time, giving a guarantee over every possible
execution of the program, unlike unsound dynamic tools that attempt
to discover when a program has exhibited nondeterministic behavior on a
specific run.  

% DeFlaker is agnostic
% to the code under test and can therefore report flakiness arising out of concurrency, which \theDeterminismChecker cannot.
